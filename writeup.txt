Portfolio Website

What the Project Is About:
- This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. 
- It showcases my skills as a frontend developer, highlights sample projects, and provides an easy way for visitors to contact me. 
- The website includes a homepage, about section, project gallery, and a functional contact form, all styled with responsive design principles.

What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Structure a semantic HTML document
- Style a website using CSS including layout, typography, and media queries
- Make a responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Add interactivity using hover effects and icon integration with Font Awesome
- Manage version control using Git and deploy the website using GitHub Pages

Challenges I Overcame:
- One of the main challenges was ensuring the site looked consistent across different devices and screen sizes. 
- Understanding how to use Flexbox and media queries effectively helped me solve layout issues. 
- I also faced some initial issues while deploying with GitHub Pages, but resolved them by troubleshooting file structure and configuration.
